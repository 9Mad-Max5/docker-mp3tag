# docker-mp3tag
MP3Tag v3.05 in docker basen on linuxserver docker-baseimage-guacgui

Right now you have install wine-mono by clicking "install" when logging in the first time,
need to find a way around that. But the image is working for now

# Docker compose example
```yml
---
version: "2"
services:
  mp3tag:
    image: xirg/docker-mp3tag
    container_name: mp3tag
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - APPNAME=mp3tag
      - GUAC_USER=abc #optional
      - GUAC_PASS=5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
      - UMASK_SET=022 #optional
      #- $CLI_ARGS= #optional
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 3389:3389
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Application Setup

This image sets up the mp3tag desktop app via wine and makes its interface available via Guacamole server in the browser. The interface is available at `http://your-ip:8080`.

By default, there is no username or password set. Custom usernames and passwords can be set via optional docker environment variables. Keep in mind that the `GUACPASS` variable accepts the `md5 hash` of the desired password (the sample above is the hash for `abc`). The md5 hash can be generated by either of the following commands:

```
echo -n password | openssl md5
```

```
printf '%s' password | md5sum
```
